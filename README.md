# Amazon-Scraper

Project: Amazon Web Scraper

    Reason: Automatically track the price of an item and update a database with the item's name, current price, the day it was accessed,
            and if it's on sale
            If the product falls below some value, email the user to tell them the product is on sale
    
    Status: Finished, but due to Amazon HTML-update (again) the project does not scrape the title properly
